# PISA 2012 Exploration
## by Maryse Bonhomme


>## Dataset Overview
PISA is the OECD's Program for International Students Assessment. The goal of the Program is to assess 15 years old in order to evaluate their skills in Math, Reading and Science. And more importantly to evaluate how prepared to the future they are by asking all sort of questions. The Survey is done by PISA every 3 years, and assess various areas of the 15 years old. They assess the students life both inside school and out of school, including at home. Asking questions about possessions, family context and even how much time the students spend on their computers.
The dataset that will be used today for analysis is the PISA 2012 survey, with participants from 65 countries.we are using the responses given by the students. The results is a huge dataset with more than 636 variables and responses from almost 510, 000 students ( 485490 rows are part of this dataset).

>## Summary of Findings
In which Subjects are students getting better scores?
* When looking at the average scores of the general populations, students tend to equally succeed at Math, Reading and Science. 
More nuances appears when analyzing the dataset by more precise criteria like gender for example.
* For Example, in average, OECD students consistently do better in all Math, Reading and Science. But one very interesting aspect is that when looking at the scores distribution, Non OECD tends to have more top students compared to non OECD countries. but also have more students getting low scores. 
* In Math test, male students tend to score a little higher than female students. But in the reading test, female students have a higher score. In Science both gender seems to perform the same.
* The median amount of time students in both OECD and Non OECD countries spend on their computers is about 50 minutes. regardless of their gender
* It seems like the amount of time spent on a computer doesn't negatively affect the students scores. but It's also seems that from 150 minutes of time spent on the computer, the concentration of top students (score above 700) really goes down. 

* This tendency doesn't vary much across regardless of genders or the country group (OECD or Non OECD). The time spent on computer doesn't seems have an effect on the scores.

* Finally, it seems like students who tend to succeed in math, reading or science is also very likely to pass the other two subjects.


>## Key Insights for Presentation
 * comparison of performance in Math, Science and Reading between Male and Female students <br>
  * comparison of performance in Math, Science and Reading between OECD and Non OECD Countries <br>
  * understanding the Math, Reading and Science scores distribution accross of the above 4 groups of interest.
  * understanding the relationship between the amount of time the students spend on their computers and their scores.
